# Alquerque
Alquerque - 2 player abstract strategic perfect information traditional board game with computer AI option.

## Abstract

_Alquerque - a board game demonstrator with computer AI using Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with UCB (Upper Confidence Bounds) applied to trees (UCT in short). Alquerque is a medieval Spanish board game closely influenced and originated from the Middle East also known there as the game called Quirkat, Qirkat, or El-Quirkat. If your sources distinguish among various variants then the most likely name for the implemented game found here might be "Alquerque de doze". The oldest written description might be by Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani in his works of Book of Songs ("Kitab al-Aghani"). Although the rules were not described in there. An medieval source mentioning rules is the Libro de los juegos affiliated to Alfonso X el Sabio of Le√≥n and Castile. Robert Charles Bell came up with modern rule proposals and enhancements later on. This Alquerque implementation has minor rule refinements that are still uncovered by neither Alfonso X nor Robert Charles Bell. Still the final rule set is close to the suggestions made by R.C. Bell._

#Description

This Alquerque is a board game using Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with UCB (Upper Confidence Bounds) applied to trees (UCT in short) for the computer player AI. The board game is used for demonstration purposes of the UCT algorithm.
